# Finding-a-similar-place
Coursera Capstone Project - For IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

#### This project is a simulation case

A company wants to transfer half of its employees to another country where it has branches. She wants these employees to be as happy in the new cities as they are in the neighborhoods they live in today. The company must send employers from ***SÃ£o Paulo***, BR to ***Toronto***, CA or ***Vancouver***, CA, but does not know them in their current neighborhood and its peculiarities.

To do this, we created a learning machine to group data from different neighborhoods in these cities, to see which location is most similar and best for each employer.

### Used Data

For this project we used dataframes of each city. 
  * toronto_data;
  * vancourver_data;
  * sao_paulo_data.

The code for make each dataframe is in PART 1 of this repository
